# Artificial Neural Networks


Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are the foundation of deep learning. They consist of interconnected neurons (nodes) that process data in layers. An ANN typically includes an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.

## Key Features:
- **Feedforward Networks:** Data flows in one direction from input to output.
- **Activation Functions:** Apply non-linear transformations to the input (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid).
- **Backpropagation:** A method to train the network by adjusting weights based on error rates.

## Applications:
- Classification
- Regression
- Pattern recognition
